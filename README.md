This is to use ESP8266 as a WiFi device which can be controlled by Alexa directly without using a Public Skill.
With this Alexa will be able to detect the Device if it is in same WiFi netwrok.
I have included fauxmoESP library (from xoseperez / fauxmoesp â€” Bitbucket https://bitbucket.org/xoseperez/fauxmoesp/src/master/) to start from signle location.
